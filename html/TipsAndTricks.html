        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>CS:GO is a difficult game. Whether you are playing casually or competitively these tips and tricks will help improve your gameplay. You may know most of them but it's still a a good reminder to not do these mistakes. This won't be your guide to becoming a professional player but just quick and easy tips which you should keep in mind while playing.</p>
        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ol class="tips">
            <li style="margin-top: 0;">Peeking corners</li>
            <ul class="peeking">
                <li>Walk and peek on head level</li>
                <p>A lot of Call of Duty players or people from other games tend to look at the ground while moving. This is extremely bad for CS:GO. If you are looking at the legs, then you will shoot at the legs. If you are properly looking at the head, then you will shoot at the head.</p>

                <li>Peeking corners while not looking at the wall</li>
                <p>This one is probably less known and minimal but still useful. When you move around a pillar or a corner make sure to look at the path, rather than the wall. Because just as looking at the ground, from the previous tip, looking at the wall doesn't help with shooting down your enemies.</p>

                <li>Peek corners while away from the wall</li>
                <p>You should always keep in mind that peeking near the wall means the enemies will see you faster and you will see them slower. When peeking, make sure to keep your distance from the wall.</p>
            </ul>

            <li>Throw more grenades</li>
            <p>A lot of beginners tend to avoid buying and throwing grenades. Grenades are very useful in every way. Of course if you throw them randomly they don't do much most of the time but throwing them smartly can win you a lot of rounds. Good flashes and smokes can get you that easy kill that you wanted. Our website offers a variety of different grenades to learn how to to throw.</p>

            <li>Consider the timings</li>
            <p>Have you ever had that time you look closely at one spot and the moment you turn away, an enemy appears? Or you shoot through the smoke and just as you are reloading an enemy apears and kills you? Well professional players often use this kind of tactic in winning peeks. Always consider what will happen when you are reloading or looking away while watching an exit. This also includes looking at the radar. If you want to check the map or reload, you should always move to a safe spot or just be patient and wait out.</p>

            <li>Pay close attention to sound</li>
            <p>Sound cannot be underestimated. Just like vision, sound is a very important aspect of the game in locating enemies. Getting a good pair of headphones can be that quick boost you wanted. But be careful because people often use sound as a means of faking and confusing you.</p>

            <li>Look at the radar more often</li>
            <p>This is extremely important if you have teamates who are not willing to communicate. Not everyone communicates in this game, you would be lucky if you get two or three people who communicates. It's important to not miss out on any kind of information the game gives you. There are also some cases when you don't see an enemy, but it pops up on your radar, so watch it! You could be missing free information!</p>

            <li>Communication is key</li>
            <p>A Lot of people, especially beginners, tend to avoid voice chat. In this game you are meant to communicate and play together as a team. Refusing to speak means you can't tell or get information properly. Your teamwork will also plummet. Also, ff you have good communication skills you can execute tactics which can win easy rounds. For example: everyone fakes A site and goes to B, or you can throw multiple smoke grenades at a site and capture it easily. You will also have more fun talking, I guarantee it! Mute all those egoistic bastards and speak with normal people. I promise you will have more fun.</p>

            <li>Plan your team money</li>
            <p>If you're playing casually this doesn't mean much but in competitive, managing your economy is important. If there's an awp laying around and your team is dead, why not take it and give it to someone? You save about 2000$. With 2000$ you can buy a famas or galil, or any other weapon.</p>

            <li>When you have a good position from behind, wait for a better one</li>
            <p>You often see this in pro plays but when you get behind someone, don't shoot immediately. Killing someone from behind isn't hard, be patient and wait. Sometimes you will get all 5 players instead of the first one you saw.</p>

            <li>Wallbanging</li>
            <p>Some poeple just forget that you can shoot through walls. If you have the chance try shooting through your nearest wall! Who knows, maybe you'll get an easy frag.</p>

            <li>Different guns have different spray patterns</li>
            <p>You may want to practice spray patterns with different guns so you could shoot your enemies more accurately. For example SG 553 has a very specific spray pattern which you may not be familiar with. You can launch a bot game and use our practice configuration or you can go to a workshop map, or you can find a community map. There are plenty of resources for doing this, so what are you waiting for?</p>
